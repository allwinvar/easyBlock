# easyBlock
A tool for generating custom blocklists directly from the YouTube UI, enabling users to filter content more efficiently. This project leverages existing content blockers (like uBlock) to allow users to create dynamic blocklists based on YouTube video elements, bridging the gap between YouTube's interface and third-party content blocking tools.
